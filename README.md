Often when configuring a server, I forget the exact syntax or a specific line. 
What I end up doing is logging into a similar server and examining a similar configuration
file. It seems every time I want to setup a user or group in sudoers for NOPASSWD, I have
to look at a previous example.

So now I'm collecting those files into one repository for easy update and quick web access.
